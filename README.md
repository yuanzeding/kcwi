# Keck Cosmic Web Imager: Post-Processing and Improvements

Welcome to `KCWIKit`!

`KCWIKit` is a community developed package to extend the official KCWI DRP with a variety of stacking tools and DRP improvements. The software offers masking and median filtering scripts to be used while running the KCWI DRP, and a step-by-step KCWI_DRP implementation for finer control over the reduction process. Once the DRP has finished, `KCWIKit` can be used to stack the output cubes via the [`Montage`](http://montage.ipac.caltech.edu/) package. Various functions cross-correlate and mosaic the constituent cubes and the final stacked cubes are WCS corrected. Helper functions can then be used to deproject the stacked cube into lower-dimensional representations should the user desire.

This repo is organized as follows:
- docs/ Documentation and Instructions
- kcwi/ Post-DRP stacking.
- scripts/ Covenient command line tools to conduct quick operations for the KCWI data. 
- DRP/ Improving the [Python pipeline](https://kcwi-drp.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
- archs/ archival programs for the [IDL pipeline](https://github.com/Keck-DataReductionPipelines/KcwiDRP).(No longer supported.)

We maintain a separate tool [`KCWI Sky Wizard`](https://github.com/zhuyunz/KSkyWizard) for the telluric correction and sky subtraction. 

## Installation

KCWIKit is recommended to be installed with `python=~3.12`. 

1. Activate the KCWI DRP environment.
    ```bash
    conda activate kcwidrp
    ```
    
    Or create a new Python environment. 

    ```bash
    conda create -n kcwikit python=3.12
    ```

2. Install `MontagePy` or the `Montage` command line tools. The two forms of the `Montage` package performs the same functions. You can choose either to install.

    `MontagePy` is generally easier to install if you have the correct `Python` environment:
    ```bash
    pip install MontagePy
    ```

    <details>
    <summary> Alternative: Install the command line version </summary>

    If the above installation fails, alternatively, you can choose to install the command line tools by compiling from the [source code](http://montage.ipac.caltech.edu/docs/download2.html).
    </details>

3. Git clone this repository and run the setup tools. 

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yuguangchen1/KcwiKit.git 
    cd KCWIKit
    pip install .
    ```

4. <details>
    <summary>(optional) Install KCWI Sky Wizard. </summary>

    `KSkyWizard` is a standalone tool to perform telluric correction and advanced sky subtraction based on PCA models for the red channel (KCRM). It is recommended to be run on `Python >= 3.11` environments. We refer to the [KSkyWizard documentation](https://github.com/zhuyunz/KSkyWizard) for the installation and instruction.
